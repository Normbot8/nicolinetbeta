One thing that we <span class="NicoliNet" value="PLAY" onclick="play()">NicoliNet</span> folks like to do its to let our founder, The Grate Nicoli, go absolutely crazy and put whatever he wants on this site. Whether that is a good idea, we do not know, but all of us here at <span class="NicoliNet" value="PLAY" onclick="play()">NicoliNet</span> will get fired if we do not allow this, so it's best we do. Goodbye for now, and have a good time in the realm of The Grate Nicoli.</p>

                <p>Minecraft is one ot the most widely played games in the world. In fact, if every person who ever bought a copy of Minecraft joined a nation, it would be the twelfth most populous nation in the world. Minecraft is simply the most awesome game ever and stuff, becuase you can do whatever you want, kind of like being the editor on <span class="NicoliNet" value="PLAY" onclick="play()">NicoliNet</span>. It is very creative. The aim of the game is to kill <a href='customize.html'>the End</a>er Dragon, seen below.</p>

                <p>What is it about the Yee Song that makes it so grate? Is it the fact that the simple repeating "YEE" sound gets stuck in your head for hours? Is it the fact that it makes absolutely no sense? Or could it be that annoying element of it all that just makes you want to scream? Whatever its qualities are, they are all multiplied by 10 in the epic 10 hour version of this hit song.</p>

                <p><span value="PLAY" onclick="play()">NicoliNet</span> is simply the best and most epic thing in the entire universe. This is because I, The Grate Nicoli, am in charge.

                <p>Rocket League. The most downloaded game on the PlayStation Store in 2016. That is right, my dudes. Rocket League is totally epic. Complete with insane boosting, explosions, and radical power-ups, Rocket League is the most epic game of epicness. And that's really all I need to say about that.</p>

                <p>Oh, yeah. That is just too awesome. Whoever took a fake photo of hurricane Sandy and made it even faker - GENIUS! I really do wish that this kinda thing could happen in real life. Photoshopped photos are just awesome that way. Besides, with Photoshop, you can make whatever you want happen. (But, unless you're prepared to spend tons of money, don't <em>actually</em> use Photoshop. Use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank">Gimp</a> or something like that.)</p>

                <p>Music is grate. There's no doubt about that. From majestic soundtracks to today's pop, music sounds good. My favorite music is a lot, but I also like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank">Fantastic Beats and Where To Find Them</a>

                <p>The books by Rick Riordan are the best. They are the perfect mashup of mythology and other stuff. They are written on multiple types of mythology, including Greek, Roman, Egyptian, and Norse. They are very cool, radical, and somewhat educational (but not too much). You know what, this almost sounds like a book review. That's just sad. Nicoli, OUT. PEACE!</p>
